1)  Start from the second element:
        Begin with the second element of the array because a single element (the first one) is already considered sorted.

2)  Take the current element:
        The element you're currently looking at is the key.

3)  Compare with the previous elements:
        Compare the key with the elements before it in the array.

4)  Shift elements to the right:
        If the key is smaller than the previous elements, shift the previous elements one position to the right to make space for the key.

5)  Insert the key:
        Place the key in its correct position within the sorted part of the array.

6)  Repeat:
        Move to the next element and repeat steps 2-5 until the entire array is sorted.
