1) Find the Smallest Element
    Start with the first element of the array as the current minimum.

2) Iterate Through the Array
    Loop through the array starting from the second element.

3) Compare Each Element
    Compare the current element with the current minimum.

4) Update the Minimum
    If the current element is smaller than the current minimum, update the minimum to the current element.

5) Swap Elements
    After iterating through the array, swap the minimum element with the first unsorted element.

6) Repeat
    Repeat steps 1 to 5 for the remaining unsorted portion of the array.

7) Continue Until Sorted
    Continue this process until the entire array is sorted.

8) Test the Sorted Array
    Once the array is sorted, test it to ensure it's in the correct order.
