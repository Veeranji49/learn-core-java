1)Start from the Beginning
    Begin with the first element of the array.


2)Compare Adjacent Elements
    Compare each element with its adjacent element.


3)Swap if Necessary
    If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them.


4)Repeat Until Sorted
    Continue this process for each pair of adjacent elements throughout the array.


5)One Pass Through the Array
    One pass through the array ensures that the largest element "bubbles up" to its correct position.


6)Repeat for Multiple Passes
    Repeat this process for multiple passes until no more swaps are needed, indicating the array is sorted.


7)Test the Sorted Array
    Once the array is sorted, test it to ensure it's in the correct order.
