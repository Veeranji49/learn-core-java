1) Define the Linear Search Method :
    Create a method that takes an array and a target value as parameters.
    The method returns the index of the target value if found, or -1 if not found.

2) Loop Through the Array
    Use a for loop to go through each element of the array.

3) Check Each Element
    Inside the loop, use an if statement to check if the current element is equal to the target value.
    If it is, return the current index.

4) Return -1 if Not Found
    If the loop completes and the target value is not found, return -1.

5) Test the Method
    In the main method, create an array and a target value.
    Call the linear search method with the array and target value.
    Print the result.
