1) Define the Binary Search Method
    Create a method that takes a sorted array and a target value as parameters.
    The method returns the index of the target value if found, or -1 if not found.

2) Initialize Low and High Indices
    Set two variables, low to 0 and high to the length of the array minus 1.

3) Loop While Low is Less Than or Equal to High
    Use a while loop to continue as long as low is less than or equal to high.

4) Calculate the Middle Index
    Inside the loop, calculate the middle index using mid = low + (high - low) / 2.

5) Check the Middle Element
    If the middle element is equal to the target, return the middle index.
    If the middle element is less than the target, set low to mid + 1.
    If the middle element is greater than the target, set high to mid - 1.

6)Return -1 if Not Found
    If the loop completes and the target value is not found, return -1.

7) Test the Method
    In the main method, create a sorted array and a target value.
    Call the binary search method with the array and target value.
    Print the result.
