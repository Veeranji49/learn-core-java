## Core JAVA

### Program :

    A program is a set of instructions, which are executed by a machine to reduce the burden
    of user or a human-being by performing the operations faster without any mistakes.

### Software :

    It is a set of programs, which can perform multiple tasks.

### Types of Software :

#### System Software :

    The softwares which are designed to interact or communicate with the hardware devices, and make 
    them work 
    Ex : OS, drivers, compilers etc.

#### Application Software :

    The software which are designed to store data, process data

### Types of Application Software :

##### Stand alone Software :

    The software which can execute in the context of a single machine.
    Ex : MS-Word, Media Player, etc..,

##### Web based Software :

    The software which can execute on any machine in the context of a browser.
    Ex : Gmail, Facebook, etc..,

### Java :

    Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that is widely used ofr developing a 
    variety of applications, including a web, desktop and mobile applications.

### difference between Java and JavaScript

    Java and Javascript are two different programming languages with different purposes. Java is used for
    building applications, while JavaScript is primarily used for adding interactivity to web pages.

### Main principle of Java Programming

    Java follows the principle of "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), which means that Java code
    can be compiled into bytecode and executed on any platform tha has a JVM.

### Java Features :

* Simple
* Object-Oriented
* Secured
* Distributed
* Platform independent
* Interpreted
* High Performance
* Portable
* Multithreaded
* Dynamic
* Robust

### Java Library :

    A Library is a collection of pre-defined programs of a language.

### Datatypes :

    The Datatypes represents the type of data that we store into the memory.

### Types of Datatypes :

#### Primitive :

    These are predefined and designed to store single value.
    Ex : int, char, double, float, boolean, etc..,

#### Derived / Non-Primitive :

    These are predefined and designed to store multiple values.
    Ex : Array, collections, interfaces, Enums, etc ..,

#### User-defined :

    If a datatype is created by user or programmer.
    Ex : class

### Variable :

    A variable is a name of memory location where we can store data.

### Variable declaration :

    The process of specifying what type of data is stored into the memory.

### Initialization :

    The process of specifying a value to a variable for the first time.

### Assignment :

    The process of specifying a value to a variable from the second time onwards or
    after the initialization.

### Keyword :

    The words that have predefined meaning in java or the words whose meaning is reserved.

### Literal :

    The values that we store into variable.

### Identifier :

    Any name that is used for the purpose of identification.

### Comments :

    The Comments are used for explaining the code. The comments make the understandability
    of  a program faster.

### Operators :

    Any symbol that performs an operation.

### Operand :

    The values on which the operations are performed

### Control Statements :

* The statement of a java program will be executed in sequencial order.
* These will help the programmer to control the flow execution in a java program.

### Switch Statement :

    It can used for executing a group of statments based on a value.

### For Loop :

    This loop can be used for executing the statements multiple times. A for loop
    has to be used when we know the exact number of iterations.

### While Loop :

    A Loop can be used for executing the statments multiple times. A while loop has to be
    used when we do not know the exact number of iterations.

### Do-While Loop :

    This loop can be used for executing the statements multiple times. A do-while loop has
    to be used when we do not know the exact number of iterations.

### Nested Loop :

    If we specify a loop inside another loop. Any loop can be specified inside any other 
    other loop any number of times.

### Break :

    Break is transfer statement which can be used either inside switch statement or inside 
    a loop.

### Continue :

    It is a transfer statement which has to be used only in loops. The continue statements
    will skip the current iteration and ocntinuous the remaining iterations.

## Arrays

### Array :

* An array is a derived datatype.
* An array is a collection of similar type of data elements to storing multiple values.
* An array helps to reduce the code size, improve the readability of the code.

#### Single Dimensional Array :

    It is a collection of multiple values represented in the form of single row or
    single column.

#### Multi dimensional Array :

    In java will represented in the form of array of arrays.

### Jagged Array :

    In multi dimensional array of the arrays have unequal size.

## Strings :

### String :

    String is a predefined class, which can be used for storing a group of characters.

  one thread at a time.
* The StringBuilder is not synchronized, and it can be accessed by multiple
  threads at a time.

### Class Loader

    It is a part of the JRE that dynamically loads Java classes into the JVM

### Difference between JDK, JVM and JRE

    JDK(Java development kit) is a software development environment which is used for developing java programs. JRE(Java Runtime Environment) is a space which enables users to execute java programs and JVM(java virtual machine) is responsible for providing the runtime environment in which java compiler generated byte code can be executed.

### static keyword

    The static keyword denotes that a member variable or method can be accessed,
    without requiring an instantiation of the class to which it belongs.

* A user cannot override static methods in java, because method overriding is based upon dynamic binding at runtime and
  static methods are statically binded at compile time.

### Pass by reference & pass by value

    When an object is passed by value, this means that a copy of the object is passed.
    Thus, even if changes are made to that object, it doesn't affect the original value
    When an object is passed by reference, this means that the actual object is not
    passed, rather a reference of the object is passed. Thus, any changes made by the external
    method, are also reflected in all places.

### difference between processes and threads

    A process is execution of a program, while a Thread is a single execution sequence within
    a process. A process can contain multiple threads. A Thread is sometimes called lightweight process.

### deadlock

    A condition that occurs when two processes are waiting for each other to complete, before 
    proceeding. The result is that both processes wait endlessly.

### Garbage Collection

    The purpose of garbage collection is to identify and discard those objects that are no
    longer needed by the application, in order for the resources to be reelaimed and reused.

### Applet

    A java applet is program that can be included in a HTML page and be executed in a java enabled 
    client browser. Applets are used for creating dynamic and interractive web applications.

### JIT compiler

    JIT(Just In Time) compiler is responsible for compiling code at runtime instead of compiling it during the compile time of the programs. It imporoves the performance of java programs by compiling the generated byte code into machine code at run time.

## Is it possible to execute a java program without main method ?

    Yes, we can execute java program without main method up to JDK 6 by intializing the static block but from JDK version 7 its mandator to include main method in java programsn because the JVM finds for main method in the program first.

## Is Java pure object-oriented language ?

    No, the Java is not a pure object oriented language. The existence of primitive data types in java language makes it as true object oriented language instead of pure because the primitive data type literals are considered as values not as objects fo to convert them to objects, they introduced wrapper classes.
