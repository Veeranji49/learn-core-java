##                                   Core JAVA

### Program :
    A program is a set of instructions, which are executed by a machine to reduce the burden
    of user or a human-being by performing the operations faster without any mistakes.

### Software :
    It is a set of programs, which can perform multiple tasks.

### Types of Software :
#### System Software :
    The softwares which are designed to interact or communicate with the hardware devices, and make 
    them work 
    Ex : OS, drivers, compilers etc.

#### Application Software :
    The software which are designed to store data, process data
    
### Types of Application Software :
##### Stand alone Software :
    The software which can execute in the context of a single machine.
    Ex : MS-Word, Media Player, etc..,

##### Web based Software :
    The software which can execute on any machine in the context of a browser.
    Ex : Gmail, Facebook, etc..,

### Java :
    Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that is widely used ofr developing a 
    variety of applications, including a web, desktop and mobile applications.

###  difference between Java and JavaScript
    Java and Javascript are two different programming languages with different purposes. Java is used for
    building applications, while JavaScript is primarily used for adding interactivity to web pages.

### Main principle of Java Programming 
    Java follows the principle of "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), which means that Java code
    can be compiled into bytecode and executed on any platform tha has a JVM.


### Java Features :
* Simple
* Object-Oriented
* Secured
* Distributed
* Platform independent
* Interpreted
* High Performance
* Portable
* Multithreaded
* Dynamic
* Robust

### Java Library :
    A Library is a collection of pre-defined programs of a language.

### Datatypes :
    The Datatypes represents the type of data that we store into the memory.

### Types of Datatypes :
#### Primitive :
    These are predefined and designed to store single value.
    Ex : int, char, double, float, boolean, etc..,

#### Derived / Non-Primitive :
    These are predefined and designed to store multiple values.
    Ex : Array, collections, interfaces, Enums, etc ..,

#### User-defined :
    If a datatype is created by user or programmer.
    Ex : class

### Variable :
    A variable is a name of memory location where we can store data.

### Variable declaration :
    The process of specifying what type of data is stored into the memory.

### Initialization :
    The process of specifying a value to a variable for the first time.

### Assignment :
    The process of specifying a value to a variable from the second time onwards or
    after the initialization.

### Keyword :
    The words that have predefined meaning in java or the words whose meaning is reserved.

### Literal :
    The values that we store into variable.

### Identifier :
    Any name that is used for the purpose of identification.

### Comments :
    The Comments are used for explaining the code. The comments make the understandability
    of  a program faster.

### Operators :
    Any symbol that performs an operation.

### Operand :
    The values on which the operations are performed

### Control Statements :
*   The statement of a java program will be executed in sequencial order.
*   These will help the programmer to control the flow execution in a java program.

### Switch Statement :
    It can used for executing a group of statments based on a value.

### For Loop :
    This loop can be used for executing the statements multiple times. A for loop
    has to be used when we know the exact number of iterations.

### While Loop :
    A Loop can be used for executing the statments multiple times. A while loop has to be
    used when we do not know the exact number of iterations.

### Do-While Loop :
    This loop can be used for executing the statements multiple times. A do-while loop has
    to be used when we do not know the exact number of iterations.

### Nested Loop :
    If we specify a loop inside another loop. Any loop can be specified inside any other 
    other loop any number of times.

### Break :
    Break is transfer statement which can be used either inside switch statement or inside 
    a loop.

### Continue :
    It is a transfer statement which has to be used only in loops. The continue statements
    will skip the current iteration and ocntinuous the remaining iterations.

## Arrays
### Array :
*  An array is a derived datatype.
*  An array is a collection of similar type of data elements to storing multiple values.
*  An array helps to reduce the code size, improve the readability of the code.

#### Single Dimensional Array :
    It is a collection of multiple values represented in the form of single row or
    single column.

#### Multi dimensional Array :
    In java will represented in the form of array of arrays.

### Jagged Array :
    In multi dimensional array of the arrays have unequal size.

## Strings :
### String :
    String is a predefined class, which can be used for storing a group of characters.

### Immutable Object :
    Once the String object is created we cannot modify the content of the object.

### StringBuilder :
    The StringBuilder class is used for storing a group of characters.

### StringBuffer :
    It is a predefined class, used for storing group of characters. StringBuffer object
    can be created in one way by using new operator.

### String class
*   The StringBuffer is synchronized(thread safe) and it can be accessed by only
    one thread at a time.
*   The StringBuilder is not synchronized, and it can be accessed by multiple 
    threads at a time.

### Command Line Arguments :
    The values that we pass into the program during the execution time in the command prompt.

    that occur in the application are two types.
*  Compile time errors
*  Runtime errors

### Try block :
    Try block is used to place the doubtful code that may rise the exception.

### Catch block :
    We can specify a group of statements that will display the information of the exception
    that has occured.

### Finally block :
    A finally is a block, in which we can specify a group of statements, that will 
    perform code cleanup activities like releasing memory, resources  etc.,

### MultiCatch block :
    We can handle multiple exceptions by writing a single catch block.

### throws :
    The throws keyword is designed to transfer or delegate the responsibilty of exception
    handling of its caller.

### Throwable :
    It is the supermost class of all runtime errors. Throwable is the subclass of object class.

### throw :
    The throw keyword is used to throw an exception object explicitly to the JVM.

### PrintStackTrace() :

    occured. This method will provide details like exception name,

### getMessage() :
    The getMessage() can be used to display only the reason for the occurance of the exception.

### UserDefined Exception :
    If an exception is created by user or programmer.

### Reflection :
    It is a process of examining or introspecting the infromation of a class during the
    execution time.

### Wrapper classes :
    These classes are used to wrap or convert a primitive datatypes into a class, so that
    the application is completely or pure object oriented.

### Class Loader
    It is a part of the JRE that dynamically loads Java classes into the JVM

### Difference between JDK and JRE
    The JRE is basically the JVM where you Java programs are being executed.
    It also includes browser plugins for applet execution. The JDK is the full featured
    software development Kit for Java, including the JRE, the compilers and tools, in order for a user to develop, compile
    and execute Java applications.

### static keyword 
    The static keyword denotes that a member variable or method can be accessed,
    without requiring an instantiation of the class to which it belongs.
*  A user cannot override static methods in java, because method overriding is based upon dynamic binding at runtime and static methods are statically binded at compile time.

### Pass by reference & pass by value
    When an object is passed by value, this means that a copy of the object is passed.
    Thus, even if changes are made to that object, it doesn't affect the original value
    When an object is passed by reference, this means that the actual object is not
    passed, rather a reference of the object is passed. Thus, any changes made by the external
    method, are also reflected in all places.

###  difference between processes and threads
    A process is execution of a program, while a Thread is a single execution sequence within
    a process. A process can contain multiple threads. A Thread is sometimes called lightweight process.

###  deadlock 
    A condition that occurs when two processes are waiting for each other to complete, before 
    proceeding. The result is that both processes wait endlessly.

### Garbage Collection
    The purpose of garbage collection is to identify and discard those objects that are no
    longer needed by the application, in order for the resources to be reelaimed and reused.

### Applet
    A java applet is program that can be included in a HTML page and be executed in a java enabled 
    client browser. Applets are used for creating dynamic and interractive web applications.
